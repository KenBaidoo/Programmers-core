					<h2 class="post-header">The Best Websites To Learn Coding And Web Development In 2020</h2>
					<p>
						Learning how to code can change your life for good – for the better. But how can 
						you find the best websites to learn coding from scratch as a beginner to achieve 
						your goals as quickly and easily as possible?
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Not too long ago, I was where you are right now. I knew I wanted to learn coding, 
						but I had no idea where to start. With all the different programming languages to 
						choose from and hundreds of online learning platforms available, I just felt 
						overwhelmed and lost.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						When you’re just getting started and you want to teach yourself to code, 
						you don’t want to waste your time browsing through hundreds of tutorials 
						and courses only to find the ones that don’t help you achieve your goals as 
						quickly as possible.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Therefore, in this post, I’ll share with you the best websites to learn coding as a beginner.
					</p>
					
					<p>Let’s dive right in!</p>
					
					<h3>WHY LEARN HOW TO CODE?</h3>
					
					<p>
						If you’re completely new to coding and web development, you might be wondering 
						why learning how to code is so important in the first place.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						When you’re just starting out, I know exactly how difficult it is to find 
						the best resources and tutorials.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						To help you stay focused and motivated, let’s take a look at some of the best 
						reasons to start learning coding:
					</p>
					
					<h3>REASON #1:<br>HIGHER INCOME AND BETTER JOB OPPORTUNITIES</h3>
					
					<p>
						If you want to learn coding from scratch to launch a new as a developer,
						congratulations! The right time teach yourself to code is now.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The employment of professional developers is estimated to grow by 13% from 
						2016 to 2026 in the US alone, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
						That is faster than the average for all occupations.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						And what’s even better: you don’t have to wait for years to start making
						money with your coding skills.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Also, you don’t need to go to college for 4 years and pay $1,000s 
						in tuitions to start a new career.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						If you decide to learn web development, you can start earning money 
						with small freelance gigs in just a matter of weeks. Step by step, 
						improve your skills by practicing and building projects for your portfolio.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						For more details, check out my article about web developer salaries 
						and how much web developers make!
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Then, when you feel confident enough in your new skills, you 
						can start applying for entry-level jobs in the industry 
						you wish to work in.
					</p>
					
					<h3>REASON #2:<br>MORE FREEDOM AND FLEXIBILITY IN LIFE</h3>
					
					<p>
						If you feel like the whole 9-to-5 world is not your thing, 
						learning how to code can help you break get off the corporate hamster wheel.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Learning programming and becoming a freelance web developer means 
						achieving absolute freedom in life.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						If you work as a freelancer or an entrepreneur, you can choose where and when to work.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I know this all too well: just 5 months after I opened my first coding book, 
						I decided to quit my office job. And even though my freelancing 
						jobs were irregular, just 6 months later I launched my own web design business.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						From that day onwards, I’ve been free to work wherever I wanted to and take a nap 
						whenever I felt like taking a break! And the best part is that I’ve never been short of work.
					</p>
					
					<h3>REASON #3:<br>SELF-EMPLOYMENT AND STARTING YOUR OWN BUSINESS</h3>
					
					<p>
						This is the path I chose – and I’ve never looked back!
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Here’s the deal: knowing how to code is like having a superpower. You’ll have an endless 
						number of possibilities to pursue your dreams by starting your own business, like:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Creating an online publication</li>
						<li>Establishing an online shop</li>
						<li>Starting your own web design agency</li>
						<li>Building mobile applications</li>
						<li>Offering coding courses and tutoring online</li>
						<li>Reviewing products on your website and earning ad income</li>
						<li>Selling licenses for media, e.g. as a professional photographer</li>
					</ul>
					
					<p>
						<b>All you need is a solid plan and strategy to get started.</b>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Once you know exactly what you wish to achieve, it’s easy to 
						find what tools and technologies you must learn to get there.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						After that, you’ll simply start learning the basics and progress 
						to more advanced tools as you go.
					</p>
					
					<h3>BEFORE YOU START: KNOW YOUR “WHY”</h3>
					
					<p>
						Before we get into the best websites to learn to code from scratch, 
						there’s one more thing you need to figure out.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						You see, learning how to code is a long journey. You can get the hang 
						of the basics pretty fast, but mastering a programming 
						language can take several years.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						That doesn’t mean you have to wait for a job for years, though. 
						You can start making money already while you learn how to code.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						That’s what I did, too. Then, gradually I started increasing the time 
						I dedicated to web dev jobs. And before long, 
						I had quit my job and started my own web design business.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						But whatever it is you wish to do with coding in the future, you need to be aware of it.
					</p>
					
					<p><b>Why do you want to teach yourself to code?</b></p>
					
					<p>
						Any answer is good here, there’s no right or wrong. You simply need to 
						take a moment to figure out what your long-term goals and aspirations are.
					</p>
					
					<p><em>Why?</em></p>
					
					<p><b>Because without clear goals, you can’t track your progress along the way!</b></p>
					
					<p>
						Trust me, it’s so much easier to learn to code from scratch when you know 
						what you’ll use your new skills for. With every coding exercise and project, 
						you’ll know that you’re one step closer to your target.
					</p>
					
					<h3>THE BEST WEBSITES TO LEARN CODING IN 2020</h3>
					
					<p>
						The number of coding sites can feel daunting if you’re just a beginner. 
						I know exactly how overwhelming it may feel – I was you not too long ago!
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Even though it may feel difficult to find the best resources to start learning, 
						the myriad of options available also means that you will find coding 
						sites that are perfect for you.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						So, depending on how you like to learn, you simply need to choose 
						a learning platform that supports your preferences.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						To help you get started, I’ve put together this list of the best 
						places to learn programming and web development as a complete beginner. 
						Many of them are 100% free, while some require a small investment to get started.
