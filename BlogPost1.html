					<p>
						I think you’ll agree with me on this: it’s REALLY hard to choose your first programming 
						
						language.

						But, it turns out, you can reduce the time you spend on finding the perfect language to 
						
						learn with a few simple steps. You don’t have to waster you valuable time on pondering 
						
						over your first programming language. I mean, you have better things to do, right?

						In today’s post, I’m going to walk you through a few simple steps that will help 
						
						you make the right choice. You can take advantage of these tips right away and find 
						
						your first programming language more easily.
					</p>
					
					<h3 class="post-header">Getting Started: Which Programming Language To Learn First?</h3>
					<p>
						The hard part is:

					You can choose between dozens of programming languages. Needless to say, the choice can 
					
					often feel overwhelming and even scary.

					But you can use a few simple tips to narrow down your options.

					Here’s the deal: Each programming language has its own characteristics, features, 
					
					and applications. Therefore, your choice depends on what you want to build and create 
					
					with coding in the future.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><em>Would you like to create web applications?</em></li>
							<li><em>Or perhaps develop iPhone or Android apps?</em></li>
							<li><em>Maybe you are interested in building games? </em></li>
							<li><em>How about data analysis and machine learning?</em></li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Depending on which are you wish to focus on, you need to learn the 
						appropriate programming languages for it.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						By now, you probably have a few ideas about what you want to build with 
						
						coding in the future. Good job!
					</p>
					
					<p>
						To get you started with learning the right tools, here are four easy steps 
						
						to help you choose your first programming language to learn:
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<ol>
							<li><a href="#anchor1">Define a clear goal</a></li>
							<li><a href="#anchor2">Find the field you want to focus on</a></li>
							<li><a href="#anchor3">Decide between back-end and front-end development</a></li>
							<li><a href="#anchor4">Know how you want to make money with coding</a></li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Let’s jump right in!
					</p>
					
					<div>
						<img class="" src="images/p3.JPG" alt="">
					</div>
					
					<h3 name="anchor1">STEP #1: DEFINE A CLEAR GOAL</h3>
					
					<p>
						When I first started learning web development, I honestly didn’t know what 
						I was doing. Although I was super motivated and driven, I didn’t know where 
						I was going with it.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						You know when you learn something new but you’re not sure what you’ll need 
						it for in the future? Somehow it doesn’t fit into a bigger picture, right?
					</p>
					
					<p>
						So, even though I was in love with learning coding, it was hard to stay 
						motivated without a clear goal and target. I was having so much fun with it, 
						but my plan was just all over the place.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Then, one day, I decided to sit down and figure out a solid plan for my learning. 
						I set myself a goal that I could achieve by learning specific tools step by step.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						And you know what? That instantly amped up my learning curve. I was able to track 
						my progress and see how far I’d come already. My motivation jumped to a whole new 
						level as I saw how much work I still had cut out for me.
					</p>
					
					<h3>WHAT YOU SHOULD DO NEXT:</h3>
					
					<p>
						First off, figure out what you wish to achieve by learning how to program.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Start by asking yourself a few questions:
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>What do you find interesting with coding and web development?</li>
							<li>What would you like to build in the future?</li>
							<li>Where would you like to work?</li>
							<li>What kind of problems would you like to solve with programming?</li>
							
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<h4>What it all boils down to is your <em>“why”</em>.</h4>
					
					<p>
						<em>Why</em> do you want to learn coding and web development in the first place?
					</p>
					
					<p>
						When you know what your goal is, you’ll know exactly what to do to achieve it. 
						You’ll save hundreds of hours of work by maintaining your focus and increasing 
						your motivation. No headaches, no frustration. Just a solid plan that tells you 
						what you need to do next.
					</p>
					
					<h3 name="anchor2">STEP #2: FIND THE FIELD YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON</h3>
					
					<p>
						When you start learning coding, you can save time by learning just the tools you 
						will actually need.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						So, now that you know your “why”, you can find a specific area to focus on with coding 
						and web development. You see, each area uses its own programming languages and technologies.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Thus, when you find a field you like, you can narrow down your options for your 
						first programming language to just a few choices.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The most common areas you can focus on are:
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><em>Making websites</em></li>
							<li><em>Creating video games</em></li>
							<li><em>Building mobile apps</em></li>
							<li><em>Making OS X or Windows applications</em></li>
							<li><em>Analysing and visualising data</em></li>
							<li><em>Focusing on Machine Learning and AI</em></li>
							<li><em>Creating 3D graphics</em></li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						All of them require you to learn specific programming languages – one or more.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Which areas do you find interesting?
					</p>
					
					<p>
						When you’ve found a couple of areas you like, it’s time to move on to our next point…
					</p>

					<h3 name="anchor3">STEP #3: BACK-END OR FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT?</h3>
					
					<p>
						If you want to become a web developer, you have two broad fields to choose from:
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<ol>
							<li><b><em>Back-end development</b> – How a website works “under the hood”</em></li>
							<li><b><em>Front-end development</b> – What a website looks and feels like</em></li>
						</ol>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						You guessed it: both areas use different programming languages. Since web 
						development is a great way to make money from coding, let’s take a closer 
						look at both.
					</p>
					
					<h3>FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT LANGUAGES</h3>
					
					<p>
						Front-end developers work on the client (or end-user) side of programming. 
						They use programming languages to create the design, look, and feel for a web project.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						As a front-end developer, you would take care of typography, colors, and layouts. 
						Your main task would be to make sure users don’t get lost or confused.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						If you want to become a front-end developer, you’ll need to learn three different languages:
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><em>HTML or HyperText Markup Language</em> – Creates the actual content and structure, 
							like text, images, lists, or tables.</li>
							
							<li><em>CSS or Cascading Style Sheets</em> – Styles the HTML content and creates a beautifully 
							designed interface.</li>
							
							<li><em>JavaScript</em> – Adds interactive and dynamic elements to make the interface more interesting.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<em>Three languages, yikes!</em>
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Don’t worry, these three front-end languages are pretty easy to learn.
					</p>
					
					<h3>HOW TO LEARN FRONT-END LANGUAGES:</h3>
					
					<p>
						If you want to make money from coding as quickly as possible, I suggest you learn 
						these three front-end languages. You can learn the basics of HTML and CSS in just 
						a few days. JavaScript takes a bit longer to master, but you can get your first 
						freelance jobs with just HTML and CSS skills.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Just remember to practice a LOT. Build your own projects and start a portfolio website 
						to showcase your skills to potential employers. Create your portfolio website with 
						WordPress to get it on its feet quickly.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						If you’ve never launched a website before, don’t worry. The easiest way to start a 
						WordPress portfolio website is to use <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/">Bluehost</a>. You’ll only need 10 minutes to set 
						up your domain and hosting account.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The best part is: When you use WordPress for your portfolio 
						website, you’ll learn how WordPress works at the same time.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Why should I mention this?
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Because WordPress is one of the most in-demand skills in web development right now. 
						Trust me, I’ve built my entire web design business based on WordPress. And I’ve never 
						been short of work.
					</p>
					
					<h3>BACK-END DEVELOPMENT LANGUAGES</h3>
					
					<p>
						Whereas front-end developers work on what’s visible to website users, back-end developers 
						work on the server-side of each project.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						They make sure the website works the way it’s supposed to. They link the front-end to the 
						more technical functionalities and features running under the hood.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						As for the programming languages used on the back-end, here are a few of the most popular 
						and best languages for web development:
					</p>
					
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>PHP</li>
							<li>Python</li>
							<li>Ruby</li>
							<li>Java</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<p><b>In short: Front-end is what you see; back-end is how it works.</b></p>
					
					<p>Just like in a restaurant: the dining area is the front-end, while the
					kitchen is the back-end.</p>
					
					<p>Of course, you could learn both back-end and front-end languages. 
					That would make you a full-stack developer.</p>
					
					<h3 name="anchor4">STEP #4: KNOW HOW YOU WANT TO MAKE MONEY FROM CODING</h3>
					
					<p>If you’re just getting started with coding and web development, 
					this question may feel overwhelming. I was you not too long ago, so 
					I know how confusing it is.</p>
					
					<p>I mean, if you haven’t even started learning your first programming 
					language yet, how could you know how you’ll make money from coding in the future?</p>
					
					<p>But don’t worry, we won’t go into too much detail here. What I want 
					you to do is just go through a few options in your mind. They’ll help 
					you guide your thoughts towards your coding goals when you start learning the basics.</p>
					
					<p>You can choose between a few options to make money from coding in the future:</p>
					
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li><em>Become a full-time developer</li>
							<li>Start your own company as an entrepreneur</li>
							<li>Become a web developer freelancer</li>
							<li>Build your own mobile apps to sell</em></li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					
					<p>Start with some research online and see what jobs are available in your area. Also, 
					find out more about the biggest employers and read a few job descriptions. What programming 
					languages and technologies do they mention?</p>
					
					<p>If you’re not sure about what to do, I would recommend starting with freelancing. 
					You can find freelance jobs online and work for clients worldwide. In short: 
					freelancing is the best way to make money from coding as quickly as possible.</p>
